 Ludo Game with Text-Based Interface and Basic AI Opponent (Python Project)

This project combines the functionalities of the previous codes to create a playable Ludo game with two functionalities:

1. Text-based Interface: Allows multiple human players to compete against each other in a classic Ludo experience.
2.  Basic AI Opponent:  Provides a single AI opponent for a single-player mode. 

Software Requirements:

* Python 3 (Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Text Editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

 Code Explanation: 

The code consists of several parts:

1. Classes:
   Player Class: Defines attributes for player name, color, and piece positions.
2. Game Functions:
   * roll_dice(): Simulates rolling a dice (returns a random number between 1 and 6).
   * move_piece(player, piece_num, roll): Moves a player's piece based on roll value and checks for collisions.
   * check_collision(players, position): Checks if another player's piece occupies the same position and sends it back if needed.
   * is_winner(player): Determines if a player has won by checking if all their pieces are in the finish area.
   * ai_move(player, roll):** (For single-player mode) Implements a basic AI strategy to choose the best move for the AI opponent. 
3. Main Gameplay Loop:
  main() function:
      * Prompts for the number of players (2 for single-player with AI or more for human players).
      * Creates players and assigns colors.
      * Enters a game loop that continues until a player wins.
      * Manages turns, dice rolls, piece movement, collision checks, and win conditions.
      * In single-player mode, uses `ai_move` to determine the AI opponent's move.

How to Use:

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., ludo_game.py).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Run the script using the `python` command followed by the file name:

   ```bash
   python ludo_game.py
   ```

4. The program will prompt you for the number of players (2 or more for human players).
5. In single-player mode (2 players), the AI opponent will make its moves automatically.
6. In multi-player mode, players take turns rolling the dice and moving their pieces.

Note:

* This is a basic implementation and lacks features like a graphical user interface and advanced AI strategies.
* The AI opponent uses a simple evaluation function to choose moves. You can improve the AI by implementing minimax algorithms or other search techniques.

This project provides a starting point for building a more feature-rich Ludo game. You can expand on it by adding functionalities like:

* A graphical user interface for a more engaging experience.
* More sophisticated AI strategies for a stronger opponent.
* Sound effects and animations for a more immersive gameplay.
